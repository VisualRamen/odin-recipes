        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your grain choice of rice! (i.e. Brown rice, short, medium, or long grain)</li>
            <li>Rice Cooker (Any brand you are comfortable with. I use tiger or zojirushi brand!)</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>With your choice of rice, measure out 3 cups of uncooked rice grain and pour into bowl provided with the rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Wash the uncooked rice grain under lukewarm or cold water and drain as much excess water without spilling rice.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 2 until rice water in bowl has become clear.</li>
            <li>Drain as much excess water as possible.</li>
            <li>Measure out 3 and 1/4 cups of water and pour into rice bowl.</li>
            <li>Place rice bowl into rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Make sure your rice cooker is plugged into a power outlet!</li>
            <li>Now switch rice cooker from "keep warm" setting, to "cook" setting.</li>
            <li>Now let the magic happen! Within 15-30 minutes, your rice will be cooked!</li>
            <li><strong>Pro Tip: After rice is cooked, allow rice to sit for at least 5-10 minutes in rice cooker before serving.</strong></li>
        </ol>
